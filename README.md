# ClockReminder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yanqd0/ClockReminder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yanqd0/ClockReminder)

To remind you in every clock on Android Wear.

## Description

It's a simple project for just one specific function: **To remind you in every clock on Android Wear**.

After the APK in the wear device installed, the APK in the mobile deivce is useless.

There is a switch on the watch, which controls the main function. Open it, then you may never touch it before uninstall.

It's small, but useful.

## About

Once I got my first Android wear device, I was shocked by its lack of functions. So I start this project as a new journey.

This project is developed to meet my own demand, but I'd like to improve it.

It's welcome to [contact me](mailto:yanqd0@outlook.com).
