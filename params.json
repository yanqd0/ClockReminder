Open it, then you may never touch it before uninstall.\r\n\r\nIt's small, but useful.\r\n\r\n## Development environment\r\n\r\n| Preparation    | Version |\r\n| :----------    | ------: |\r\n| Oracle JDK     | 1.8     |\r\n| Android SDK    | 24      |\r\n| Android Studio | 2.1.3   |\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nIn fact, I really don't understand why I chose AGPL as the license of this project. I wish nothing would be wrong in the future.\r\n\r\n>    ClockReminder: To remind you in every clock on Android Wear.\r\n>\r\n>    Copyright (C) 2016 Yan QiDong\r\n>\r\n>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n>    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\r\n>    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n>    (at your option) any later version.\r\n>\r\n>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

So I start this project as a new journey.\r\n\r\nThis project is developed to meet my own demand, but I'd like to improve it.\r\n\r\nIt's welcome to [contact me](mailto:yanqd0@outlook.com).\r\n",
